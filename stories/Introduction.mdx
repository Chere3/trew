# Design System

Welcome to the Conversational AI SaaS Design System. This design system provides a comprehensive set of components, patterns, and guidelines for building modern, accessible, and scalable conversational interfaces.

## Design Philosophy

This design system is built with the following principles:

- **Modern YC SaaS Aesthetic**: Clean, professional, and enterprise-credible
- **Tactile Interactions**: Retro-realistic button styling with physical depth
- **Visual Clarity**: Inspired by Vercel's clean design language
- **Smooth Interactions**: Intelligent micro-interactions inspired by Gemini
- **Blue as Primary**: Clean, vibrant blue signals action and intelligence
- **Neutrals Dominant**: Zinc-based neutrals form the foundation with off-white, light gray, and charcoal tones

## Component Categories

### Foundations
Design tokens including colors, typography, and spacing that form the base of the system.

### UI Components
Core interface components like buttons, cards, inputs, and dialogs. These are the building blocks used throughout the application.

### Chat Components
Specialized components for conversational interfaces including message bubbles, lists, and typing indicators.

### Input Components
Components for user input including message composer, quick replies, and voice input.

### Media Components
Components for displaying rich content like code blocks, markdown, images, and tables.

### Feedback Components
Components for system feedback including loading states, error messages, and empty states.

### Navigation Components
Layout and navigation components including headers, sidebars, and search bars.

### User Components
Components for user management including profiles, menus, and settings panels.

## Getting Started

1. Browse the component library in the sidebar
2. View component documentation and examples
3. Use the playground to experiment with props
4. Copy code examples for your implementation

## Design Tokens

All components use design tokens for consistency:
- **Colors**: Blue primary scale (Tailwind Blue) with Zinc-based neutral backgrounds
- **Typography**: Inter font family optimized for reading
- **Spacing**: 4px base unit system
- **Shadows**: Tactile button shadows for depth

## Accessibility

All components follow WCAG 2.1 AA guidelines:
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility
- Color contrast compliance
- ARIA attributes where needed
