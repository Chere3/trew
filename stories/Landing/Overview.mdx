## Usage Patterns

### Features Section

The Features component displays six key features in a responsive grid:

```tsx
import { Features } from '@/components/landing/Features'

<Features />
```

Each feature card includes:
- **UI Mockup**: Visual representation of the feature using actual UI components
- **Gradient Title**: Title with gradient text overlay on the image
- **Description**: Clear explanation of the feature's benefit

### Feature Cards Structure

```tsx
{
  title: "Feature Name",
  description: "Feature description",
  gradient: "from-color-500/10 to-color-500/10", // Card background
  titleGradient: "from-color-500 to-color-500", // Title text gradient
  mockup: MockupComponent // React component for UI mockup
}
```

## Design Principles

- **Visual Hierarchy**: Gradient overlays ensure titles are readable over mockups
- **Consistency**: All cards follow the same structure and spacing
- **Interactivity**: Hover effects provide visual feedback
- **Responsiveness**: Grid adapts from 1 column (mobile) to 3 columns (desktop)

## Best Practices

- Keep mockup components simple and focused on the feature
- Use consistent aspect ratios for mockup areas
- Ensure gradient overlays provide sufficient contrast for readability
- Maintain consistent spacing and padding across cards

## Accessibility

- All feature cards are keyboard navigable
- Gradient overlays ensure text contrast meets WCAG standards
- Descriptive text provides context for visual mockups
- Cards use semantic HTML structure
