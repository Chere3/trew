# Input Components

Input components provide various ways for users to interact with the conversational interface, from text input to voice and file attachments.

## Components

### MessageComposer
Main chat input field with auto-resize, attachments, and voice input support.

### QuickReplies
Suggestion chips for quick responses in conversations.

### AttachmentPicker
File upload interface with preview, validation, and removal.

### VoiceInput
Voice recording component with speech-to-text conversion.

### CommandPalette
Slash commands and quick action interface.

## Usage Patterns

### Basic Message Input
```tsx
<MessageComposer
  onSend={(message) => handleSend(message)}
  placeholder="Type your message..."
/>
```

### With Quick Replies
```tsx
<QuickReplies
  replies={[
    { id: '1', label: 'Yes' },
    { id: '2', label: 'No' },
  ]}
  onSelect={(reply) => handleQuickReply(reply)}
/>
```

## Best Practices

- Use Server Actions for form submission
- Handle file uploads via Server Actions or Route Handlers
- Voice input requires browser APIs (Client Component only)
- Debounce search inputs for better performance
- Validate file types and sizes before upload

## Accessibility

- Keyboard navigation for all inputs
- Screen reader labels for file inputs
- Voice input requires microphone permissions
- Clear error messages for validation failures
